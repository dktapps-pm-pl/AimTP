# AimTP
Teleport in PocketMine-MP by aiming and clicking

## Why?
Flying is too slow, teleporting using commands is tedious (and requires memorizing coordinates), and ender pearls have limited range.
Presenting: the easiest way to hop around without needing to stop and think about it.

## Usage
1. Get a teleport stick using `/give <player> tpstick`, and hold it in the main hand
2. Look where you want to go
3. Right click (or click & hold on mobile)
4. Profit!

## Permissions
- `aimtp.use`: Controls the ability to use teleporter stick items. Defaults to op only.

## Gotchas
- You can't teleport into the sky or the void, only between 0-255 Y coordinates
- You can't teleport further than 256 blocks in one jump (safety restriction)
